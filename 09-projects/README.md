## üîß Development Setup

### Running Console Applications:
```bash
# Compile and run simple calculator
javac SimpleCalculator.java
java SimpleCalculator

# Run advanced calculator
javac AdvancedCalculator.java
java AdvancedCalculator
```

### Running Modular Applications:
```bash
# Compile all related files
javac *.java

# Run main application
java Main
```

### Running GUI Applications:
```bash
# Compile GUI application
javac CalculatorFrame.java
java CalculatorFrame

# Run admission form
javac AdmissionForm.java
java AdmissionForm
```

## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Compilation Errors:
- **Missing imports**: Add required import statements
- **Class not found**: Ensure all related files are compiled
- **Method not found**: Check method names and parameters

### Runtime Errors:
- **NumberFormatException**: Validate user input before parsing
- **NullPointerException**: Initialize objects before use
- **GUI not showing**: Ensure proper event dispatch thread usage

### Logic Errors:
- **Incorrect calculations**: Test with known values
- **Event not triggered**: Check event listener registration
- **Data not saved**: Verify file operations and permissions

## üìä Project Assessment
