# üî§ Java Fundamentals

This section covers the essential building blocks of Java programming. Master these concepts before moving to more advanced topics.

## üìö Topics Covered

### [01-syntax](./01-syntax/) - Java Syntax Basics
- Basic Java structure and syntax rules
- Comments and documentation
- Java tokens and keywords
- Code organization principles

**Key Learning Points:**
- Understand Java's case-sensitive nature
- Learn proper use of braces, parentheses, and semicolons
- Master single-line and multi-line comments
- Recognize Java keywords and identifiers

### [02-variables](./02-variables/) - Variables and Data Types
- Primitive data types (`int`, `double`, `boolean`, etc.)
- Variable declaration and initialization
- Naming conventions and best practices
- Type conversion and casting

**Key Learning Points:**
- Declare variables using proper syntax
- Understand memory allocation for different data types
- Follow Java naming conventions (camelCase)
- Perform basic type conversions

### [03-operators](./03-operators/) - Operators
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- Relational operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- Bitwise operators
- Assignment operators

**Key Learning Points:**
- Perform mathematical calculations
- Compare values and make decisions
- Combine multiple conditions
- Understand operator precedence

### [04-control-flow](./04-control-flow/) - Control Flow
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Loop control (`break`, `continue`)
- Nested structures

**Key Learning Points:**
- Make decisions in your programs
- Repeat code efficiently
- Control program execution flow
- Handle complex conditional logic

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this section, you will:
1. Write syntactically correct Java programs
2. Declare and use variables effectively
3. Perform calculations and comparisons
4. Control program flow with conditions and loops
5. Debug basic syntax and logic errors

## üìù Practice Strategy

For each topic:
1. **Read** the concept explanation
2. **Study** the provided code examples
3. **Type** the code yourself (don't just copy-paste)
4. **Modify** the examples to see what happens
5. **Practice** with the exercises

## üîó Learning Path

Follow this sequence for optimal learning:

```
01-syntax ‚Üí 02-variables ‚Üí 03-operators ‚Üí 04-control-flow
```

Each topic builds upon the previous one, so complete them in order.

## ‚ö° Quick Reference

### Essential Syntax Rules:
- Every statement ends with `;`
- Code blocks use `{` and `}`
- Class names start with uppercase
- Variable names start with lowercase
- Use camelCase for multi-word names

### Basic Program Structure:
```java
public class ClassName {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```

## üéÆ Hands-On Exercises

After completing each section, try these progressive exercises:

1. **Basic Calculator**: Use operators to create a simple calculator
2. **Grade Classifier**: Use conditions to classify grades (A, B, C, D, F)
3. **Number Patterns**: Use loops to create various number patterns
4. **Guessing Game**: Combine all concepts in a simple guessing game

## üîó Next Steps

After mastering fundamentals:
- Move to [02-arrays-strings](../02-arrays-strings/) for data structures
- Practice with [exercises/beginner](../exercises/beginner/) problems
- Review concepts by teaching them to someone else
